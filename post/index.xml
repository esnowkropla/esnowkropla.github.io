      <description>Once I am sure there&amp;#39;s nothing going on I step inside, letting the door thud shut. Another church: matting, seats, and stone And little books; sprawlings of flowers, cut For Sunday, brownish now; some brass and stuff Up at the holy end; the small neat organ; And a tense, musty, unignorable silence, Brewed God knows how long. Hatless, I take off My cycle-clips in awkward reverence. Move forward, run my hand around the font.</description>

      <description>O my Luve&amp;#39;s like a red, red rose That’s newly sprung in june; O my Luve&amp;#39;s like the melodie That’s sweetly play&amp;#39;d in tune: As fair art thou, my bonnie lass, So deep in luve am I: And I will luve thee still, my dear, Till a’ the seas gang dry: Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear, And the rocks melt wi’ the sun: I will luve thee still, my dear, While the sands o’ life shall run.</description>

      <description>A certain critic - for such men, I may regret to say, do exist - made the nasty remark about my last novel that it contained &amp;lsquo;all the old Wodehouse characters under different names&amp;rsquo;. He has probably now been eaten by bears, like the children who made mock of the prophet Elisha: but if he still survives he will not be to make a similar charge against Summer Lightning. With my superior intelligence, I have outgeneralled the man this time by putting in all the old Wodehouse characters under the same names.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Rust Web-Development</title>
      <link>https://ejsk.ca/post/rust-web2/</link>

      <description>This entry will be a little scattershot, just some miscellaneous thoughts and impressions.
Interacting with APIs It&amp;rsquo;s a little inconvenient to be making a lot of little structs for each feature of an API; where in JavaScript or Python you would have a dictionary, if you want type safety you need to make a struct with the proper fields. Strictly speaking you don&amp;rsquo;t need to; operating on untyped JSON is actually fairly straightforward, but when you know that the rest of your codebase isn&amp;rsquo;t going to crash the parts that aren&amp;rsquo;t guarenteed by the compiler niggle in your brain.</description>

      <title>Rust Web-Development, Part 1</title>

      <description>Now that Hairy Little Buggers is wrapped up, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d use my sabbatical to dive into web-development. This is also a good chance to play with Rust again; the last time I checked it out was before 1.0 when I was playing with the Matasano crypto challenges, so it will be interesting to see how much more mature the ecosystem is.
Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anything about web-development, so after a little research I picked up Flask Web Development based on the Flask Mega-Tutorial.</description>

      <description>God of our fathers, known of old, Lord of our far-flung battle line, Beneath whose awful hand we hold Dominion over palm and pine - Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget - lest we forget! The tumult and the shouting dies; The Captains and the Kings depart: Still stands thine ancient sacrifice, An humble and a contrite heart. Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget - lest we forget!</description>

      <description>The shades of night were falling fast, As through an Alpine village passed A youth, who bore, &amp;#39;mid snow and ice, A banner with the strange device, Excelsior! His brow was sad; his eye beneath, Flashed like a falchion from its sheath, And like a silver clarion rung The accents of that unknown tongue, Excelsior! In happy homes he saw the light Of household fires gleam warm and bright; Above, the spectral glaciers shone, And from his lips escaped a groan, Excelsior!</description>

      <description>Alright, I&amp;rsquo;ve rejiggered my website yet again. This actually has some functionality, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll actually manage to stick to it this time. Then again, the mark of a true academic is to neglect their website.</description>
