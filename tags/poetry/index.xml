      <description>A certain critic - for such men, I may regret to say, do exist - made the nasty remark about my last novel that it contained &amp;lsquo;all the old Wodehouse characters under different names&amp;rsquo;. He has probably now been eaten by bears, like the children who made mock of the prophet Elisha: but if he still survives he will not be to make a similar charge against Summer Lightning. With my superior intelligence, I have outgeneralled the man this time by putting in all the old Wodehouse characters under the same names.</description>

      <description>God of our fathers, known of old, Lord of our far-flung battle line, Beneath whose awful hand we hold Dominion over palm and pine - Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget - lest we forget! The tumult and the shouting dies; The Captains and the Kings depart: Still stands thine ancient sacrifice, An humble and a contrite heart. Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget - lest we forget!</description>

      <description>The shades of night were falling fast, As through an Alpine village passed A youth, who bore, &#39;mid snow and ice, A banner with the strange device, Excelsior! His brow was sad; his eye beneath, Flashed like a falchion from its sheath, And like a silver clarion rung The accents of that unknown tongue, Excelsior! In happy homes he saw the light Of household fires gleam warm and bright; Above, the spectral glaciers shone, And from his lips escaped a groan, Excelsior!</description>
