      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;God of our fathers, known of old,
Lord of our far-flung battle line,
Beneath whose awful hand we hold
Dominion over palm and pine -
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget - lest we forget!

The tumult and the shouting dies;
The Captains and the Kings depart:
Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,
An humble and a contrite heart.
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget - lest we forget!

Far-called our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget - lest we forget!

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings as the Gentiles use,
Or lesser breeds without the Law -
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget - lest we forget!

For heathen heart that puts her trust
In reeking tube and iron shard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
And guarding calls not Thee to guard,
For frantic boast and foolish word-
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Load!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;The shades of night were falling fast,
As through an Alpine village passed
A youth, who bore, &#39;mid snow and ice,
A banner with the strange device,
    Excelsior!
	
His brow was sad; his eye beneath,
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath,
And like a silver clarion rung
The accents of that unknown tongue,
    Excelsior!

In happy homes he saw the light
Of household fires gleam warm and bright;
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,
And from his lips escaped a groan,
    Excelsior!

&amp;quot;Try not the Pass!&amp;quot; the old man said;
&amp;quot;Dark lowers the tempest overhead,
The roaring torrent is deep and wide!&amp;quot;
And loud that clarion voice replied,
    Excelsior!

&amp;quot;Oh stay,&amp;quot; the maiden said, &amp;quot;and rest
They weary head upon this breast!&amp;quot;
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,
But still he answered, with a sigh,
    Excelsior!

&amp;quot;Beware the pine-tree&#39;s withered branch!
Beware the awful avalanche!&amp;quot;
This was the peasant&#39;s last Good-night,
A voice replied, far up the height,
    Excelsior!

At break of day, as heavenward
The pious monks of Saint Bernard
Uttered the oft-repeated prayer,
A voice cried through the startled air,
    Excelsior!

A traveller, by the faithful hound,
Half-buried in the snow was found,
Still grasping in his hand of ice
That banner with the strange device,
    Excelsior!

There in the twilight cold and gray,
Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay,
And from the sky, serene and far,
A voice fell like a falling star,
    Excelsior!

-Longfellow
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, I&amp;rsquo;ve rejiggered my website yet again.  This actually has some functionality, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll actually manage to stick to it this time.  Then again, the mark of a true academic is to neglect their website.&lt;/p&gt;
